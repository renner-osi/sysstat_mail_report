RHEL usage
===================
On RHEL:
`sudo yum install -y  sysstat python36-devel gnuplot sendmail-devel optipng git`


`systemctl start sysstat`
`systemctl enable sysstat`

git clone https://github.com/renner-osi/sysstat_mail_report.git

python35 sysstat_mail_report/sysstat_report.py daily 'Sysstat renner@osi.io' 'rrenner@redhat.com'
python36 sysstat_mail_report/sysstat_report.py daily 'Sysstat renner@osi.io' 'rrenner22@gmail.com'
python36 sysstat_report.py daily 'Sysstat renner@osi.io' 'rrenner@redhat.com'

Sysstat Mail Report
===================

Send daily/weekly/monthly email reports with graphs plotted from sysstat monitoring data.

There are a lot of tools available to plot sysstat data and generate graphs, but they either have important limitations, or require a web server running to serve the graphs.

This tool attempts to be simple and efficient and allow generating periodic reports (from cron) to be emailed directly.


## Features

* Allow generating daily/weekly/monthly reports
* Generates graphs with data from 5min load average, CPU usage, memory usage, swap usage, network IO and drive IO (see examples below), additionnaly display reboot times
* Construct email with both PNG and alternate ASCII graphs to be compatible with text only mail clients, or low bandwith mail viewing
* Automatically scale graphs according to system characteristics (ie. get total memory for memory graph y axis)
* Weekly and monthly graphs are automatically smoothed (hides small variations better viewed on daily graphs) to remain readable
* Properly handle special cases like DST time shifts, months with less than 30 days, etc
* Few dependencies: sysstat, gnuplot, sendmail and Python 3.4 (no Python package dependencies): install is as simple as copying a file on most servers. No server or daemon is required or installed.
* Automatically crunch images to save a few KB per email without any loss of quality
* Optionally support SVG images for crisp looking graphs <sup>1</sup>

<sup>1. SVG rendering has been tested successfully in Thunderbird and Geary email clients, but is not supported by GMail (as of 2015/09/07), and probably many other older clients. In case of doubt, use the default PNG + text fallback mode.</sup>

## Dependencies

* [Python >= 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Gnuplot >= 4.6](http://www.gnuplot.info/)
* sendmail (configured and operational to send emails)
* [optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/) (optional)

And of course [sysstat](http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/).

On Ubuntu and other Debian derivatives, you can install all of them with:  
`sudo apt-get install sysstat python3 gnuplot-nox sendmail-bin optipng`


On RHEL:
`sudo yum install -y  sysstat python36-devel gnuplot sendmail-devel optipng`


`systemctl start sysstat`
`systemctl enable sysstat`


## Installation

Download it to `/usr/local/bin`, ie with:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/desbma/sysstat_mail_report/master/sysstat_report.py > /usr/local/bin/sysstat_report.py && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sysstat_report.py


### Sysstat configuration

For the weekly and monthly reports to be generated properly, you may need to increase the value of `HISTORY` in `/etc/sysstat/sysstat`, to respectively at least 7 and 31.

Stat files compressed with bzip2 are handled properly.


## Usage

The recommanded way of calling the script is through a cron job, so for example for a daily report, create the file `/etc/cron.daily/sysstat-report`, make it executable, and add the lines:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec sysstat_report.py daily 'Sysstat <email.from@example.com>' 'email.to@example.com'

When the script is called every day, you will receive an email with the graphs for the previous day.

Run `sysstat_report.py -h` to get full command line reference.
